/*
 * Piscina Thread Worker Management
 *   - This is a generic pool of between 5-10 workers for use in
 *     data conversion/formatting endpoints that tend to take
 *     longer to process.
 *   - Note that the worker id's may increase over time there is
 *     never more than maxThreads (actual count = piscina.threads.length) 
 *     workers running at one time. This is due to the ability of
 *     Piscina to retire threads when the server load is low.
